# INTRODUCTION

Hello, I am Nikhil Abraham and I am a Fourth year undergraduate student pursuing B.Tech in Mechanical engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Bombay. I was selected as a participant of the Google Summer of Code Programme, 2017, and will be working with RoboComp throught this summer. RoboComp is an open-source Robotics framework providing the tools to create and modify software components that communicate through public interfaces. 

During this summer I will be working on improving robocompdsl, the code generator in robocomp using model checking techniques and good software engineering practices. Robocomp is based on DSL technology. In this proposal we seek to improve the robustness of the generated code. I will be extending robocompdsl, to include verification points, asserts, parameter range control, etc independent of the specific functionality of the component.

Till now I had worked on various issues including 

* Added information regarding the status of IceStorm
* Improved Semantic Error messages
* Improved pyparsing Error messages
