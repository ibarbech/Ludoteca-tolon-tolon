### Introduction


Hey! I am Lashit Jain. I'm an undergraduate researcher at IIIT Hyderabad. My research work focuses on Automated Planning and Multiagent Systems. 

### My Project

Consider a situation where a robot has to move a teapot from kitchen to a room. It can do this task by performing some actions. The problem is that we have huge number of actions to consider. The solution therefore is to select relevant actions from the action set. Like in our example, for transferring teapot from kitchen to a room, picking up microwave is an irrelevant action.

So the plan for my GSoC project is to use learning algorithms to learn the relevance of every action.
