# Learnbot-DSL version 2 is ready!

August 20, 2017

The Third period of GSoC comes to an end and I have successgully completed the version 2 of Learnbot DSL.
I have prepared a slideshow to explain the entire Learnbot DSL from scratch.
Here's the [link](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1AN1_6moCLcTjmeyPX2aGd1fl6cLJwDTbMb8LpaXGcWE/edit?usp=sharing)
I have kept this post extremely short because the slides cover everything.

Thank you!
